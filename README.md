Playground
==========

Playground attempts to add a layer of abstraction between the programmer and
Signals.

Examples
========
* Increment: Shows how to create a basic program in which a number is incremented on the screen and pressing space resets the value to 0.
  - [Demo](http://jcollard.github.io/elm/Playground/Increment.html)

* Ball: Shows how to create a simple interactive "game" where you can move a ball with the arrow keys and change the color using '1', '2', and '3'.
  - [Demo](http://jcollard.github.io/elm/Playground/Demo.html)
